All included files relate to Dylan Horowitz's final project in Computational Linguistics. 

This project's goal was to create a DNN that could determine whether or not a tweet contained hate speech.

The actual training algorithm is the python program "DNN", with the other python programs enclosed being used to help create the testing and training datasets.

Current Problems:
The algorithm returns near-perfect results. This seems to be an issue with the dataset, as I believe there is currently a lack of ambiguous cases.
This is to be expected, as very few actual datasets exist for this research and I had to create my own.
Future work should involve create datasets that better test the accuracy of the DNN.
